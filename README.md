# MNIST Classification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple machine learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.

## Features
- Uses the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification
- Implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Preprocesses the dataset for optimal training performance
- Trains the model with optimized parameters
- Evaluates the model's accuracy on test data

## Dataset
You can find the MNIST dataset here: [MNIST Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist)
